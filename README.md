# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Tareas calificadas por los compa√±eros: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 




This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected: 

First the script merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Then extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

Finally creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
